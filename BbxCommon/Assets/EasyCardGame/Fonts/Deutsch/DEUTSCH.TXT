The Deutsch Gothic font is a display font based upon an old German gothic alphabet.  The font contains the upper and lower case alphabets, numbers and punctuation.

This font was created using Fontographer for Windows.  It is (c) 1994 by J. Fordyce but may be freely distributed provided it is not altered, no fee is charged for it, and this text file is included with it.
